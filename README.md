# Brandon Brugman
Hey! I'm Brandon and I'm a second-degree seeking student working towards a job as a Software Engineer. I have a background in sales and customer service, but decided to take the plunge into a career change and am loving every second of it! 

While I haven't found a facet of software engineering I haven't enjoyed yet, my two favorites I've found in the program are web and Android development. I look forward for new challenges and can't wait to see what the future brings!
